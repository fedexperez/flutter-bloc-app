# Flutter Bloc App

Practice App where we will cover topics about:

* Flutter Bloc
* BLoC
* Events
* States
* BlocMultiProvider
* Get status information
* Emit events

The BLoC is considered by many the most robust state manager but at the same time it can look very complex, the goal is that we can better understand the Bloc to see its potential.
